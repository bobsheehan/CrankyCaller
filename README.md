# CrankyCaller 
### Prototype only

A little bit pokiemon go, a little bit potential stalker, you can either have your location tracked or click on map locations to find an address to see if there are published names and phone numbers.

Also this intentionally requires user input (button clicks) simply to not blow over usage limits. Currently hosted at https://crankycall.azurewebsites.net 
 
- Uncheck the tracking checkbox if you are not using your cellphone /walking around. Then click on the map for an address. 

- Use the joke menu to get some silly prank call ideas.

This simply screen scrapes a few sites and is prone to change.
